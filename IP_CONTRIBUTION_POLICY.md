Gastbot – IP & Contribution Policy

Author: Vladimir Voblikov (vovkvant)
Date: 2025-10-30
Project: Gastbot Platform

**1. Purpose**

This document defines the ownership, usage terms, and intellectual property rights associated with all code, modules, algorithms, designs, documentation, and related materials created or contributed by Vladimir Voblikov (the Author) as part of the Gastbot project.

It complements the main LICENSE file and together they form the complete intellectual property framework of the Gastbot platform.

**2. Ownership of Intellectual Property**

All source code, logic, architecture, or technical assets created by the Author remain his exclusive intellectual property, regardless of where the code is stored or deployed (including partner repositories, production servers, or derived builds).

No transfer of ownership, rights, or title is implied by participation in the project unless explicitly confirmed in a separate, signed written agreement.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Author.

**3. Granted Rights (Limited License)**

The partner is granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Author’s contributions solely for the purpose of developing, operating, and maintaining the Gastbot Platform.

This license:

* does not grant any ownership or resale rights, 
* does not authorize sublicensing or distribution, 
* and is valid only within the scope of the Gastbot project.

Any commercial use, sublicensing, sale, or transfer of the Author’s code requires a separate License Agreement or Royalty Agreement signed by both parties.

**4. Core Components**

The module referred to as “gastbot-widget-api” (including backend logic, database layers, service orchestration, and metrics subsystems) is considered the proprietary core of the Gastbot system.

The Gastbot core and all its derivative works remain the sole property of the Author and may not be reproduced, modified, or deployed outside of the licensed environment without written authorization.

**5. Attribution and Integrity**

All files created or modified by the Author must retain a copyright notice:

`Copyright (c) 2025 Vladimir Voblikov. All rights reserved.`


The partner or third parties shall not remove, obscure, or alter this notice or any license header.

**6. Evidence and Verification**

* All commits authored by Vladimir Voblikov in the version-control system constitute verifiable evidence of authorship and contribution. 
* The Author may independently archive, mirror, or notarize these repositories (including cryptographic timestamping via OpenTimestamps or similar technologies) as proof of creation and ownership. 
* Such independent backups do not violate any confidentiality provisions and exist solely to protect authorship rights.

**7. Future Agreements**

Any additional agreements regarding profit-sharing, royalties, or code licensing will be executed separately and in writing.
This Policy remains valid until explicitly superseded by such a signed agreement.

**8. Governing Principle**

This policy aims to maintain transparency, fairness, and respect for intellectual property in collaborative software development.
It is not a transfer of ownership but a statement of retained rights and licensed usage.
